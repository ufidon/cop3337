# Problem 1
Write the following function that returns a new string in which the uppercase letters are changed to lowercase and lowercase to uppercase. 

```C++
string swapCase (const string & n) 
``` 

Write a test program (main) that prompts the user to enter a string and invokes this function and displays the return value from this function. 

# Problem 2
Write a complete C++ program that creates a pointer called p and an integer variable called num with a value 5. Your program must print the following outputs: 
* Print the value of the integer number directly from the num variable.  
* Print the value of the integer number indirectly from the p pointer. 
* Print the address of the integer variable directly from the num variable (Use &). 
* Print the address of the integer variable indirectly from the p pointer. 
* Print the value of the p pointer. 
* Print the address of the p pointer. 

# Problem 3
Write a function that returns the sum of values at even indexes of an array with the following headers: 

```C++
double sumEven (const double * arr, int size) 
```

Write a test program that reads six double values, invokes this function, and displays the sum of values at even indexes.
