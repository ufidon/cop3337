# Problem 1
Write a function that counts and returns number of digits in an integer number using the following header:  

```C++
int getDigit (int n) 
``` 

For example, getDigit(139) will return 3 and getDigit(31415) will return 5. Write a test program (main) that prompts the user to enter an integer and displays number of digits in the given integer number.

# Problem 2
Write a program that displays the following table (note that 1 meter is 3.280 feet). You must also use setw(10)  to specify the number of columns for each column. Use the left manipulator to left-justify your output and setprecision() manipulator to specify number of digits.

# Problem 3
Write a program that plays the popular scissor, rock, paper game. (A scissor can cut a paper, a rock can knock a scissor, and a paper can wrap a rock). The program randomly generates a number 0, 1, or 2 representing scissor, rock, or paper. The program prompts the user to enter a number 0, 1, or 2 and displays a message indicating whether the user or the computer wins, loses, or draws.
